# Hello

This is my solution for the csv puzzle, you can use the input file in the solution or provide your own _in the same format_,
the program will read the input file and produce two files
* 0_file.csv will contain the products and average for each product
* 1_file.csv will contain the product and it's most popular brand

SORRY I had issues getting file names from user so I hard coded them


# Just run the main.rb
